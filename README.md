Hi everyone,

My name is Hoang Hau. I am currently a third-year student at Foreign Trade University, majoring in Accounting and Auditing. I am passionate about finance, accounting systems, and auditing practices, and I am always eager to improve my professional knowledge and practical skills in these fields.

I am responsible, detail-oriented, and willing to learn from new experiences. I look forward to gaining more hands-on experience and developing myself further in the accounting and auditing profession.

Thank you!
